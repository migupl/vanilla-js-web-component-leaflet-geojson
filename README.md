# A vanilla JavaScript Web Component for Leaflet maps

Behind this idea is learning about:
- Use the open-source JavaScript library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) for playing with maps
- Web Components

## Helpers

A [container is used for hot reloading](https://github.com/migupl/hot-reloading-container) during development.

Good luck and I hope you enjoy it.
